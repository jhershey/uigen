Your goal is to update any vulnerable dependencies.

Do the following:
1. run `npm audit` to find any vulnerable installed packages in this project.
-- exit if there aren't any updates, otherwise proceed with step 2.
2. run `npm audit fix` to apply updates.
3. run tests and verify the updates didn't break anything.
